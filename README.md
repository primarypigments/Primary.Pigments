# [PRIMARY.PIGMENTS](https://primarypigments.github.io/Primary.Pigments)


I created Primary Pigments to fill a need in the community.  There are many people who are in need of support or wanting to create but do not have access to an option that is simple and local.
Primary Pigments goals are to encourage emotional resilience, nurture self-esteem and self-awareness, promote insight, enhance social skills, minimize and find solutions for conflicts and distress, and create harmony in societal and ecological change. We aim for people who had traumas in their lives and are stuck in this moment. We are also happy with individuals who want to grow creatively and be social. We intend to give our community the opportunity to express their inner thoughts, while helping them to better understand and make sense of their emotions and their mental health. The goals, ideas and ideals are not achieved through interacting with the website, instead this site acts as a vessel to guide the user to join and to meet at the events.
Primary Pigments website makes the effort to keep the information simple and not overbearing so that the user is not overwhelmed and moves on somewhere else for their creative and/self help needs. We do this by explaining 3 componest about our club, "what to expect, our goals, meetings" followed by corresponding paintings.
We also present a series of paintings from our members. These represent the possibilities healing can be achieved through art.  Our contact page is also simple. We do ask potential members to provide their name, email. postal code, a password used to gain access to the meetings, an agreement of being respectful, phone number, and we do ask potential members to introduce themselves in a short message. We have had great success thus far and now we want to present this club to the surrounding areas of Kakenstorf to find more people who can use this service.






Deployed site as an example:

### Colour Scheme




I chose this color scheme because it is easy on the eyes and brings a calming feeling,  I believe my users are looking for a site that are these things and will in turn get them to join,


As for the background color I decided to use Cssgradient. https://cssgradient.io/
For Website color scheme I used Google http://google.com


I will explain the uses of the various colors below, starting from top to bottom.




The main background color uses a linear-gradient:


```css
linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(240, 239, 239, 1) 0%, rgba(246, 247, 242, 1) 22%, rgba(236, 242, 228, 1) 100%, rgba(246, 247, 242, 1) 100%);
```


- `#272b54` : This is the border color.
- `#272b54` : This is the accent color.
- `#272b54` : This is the main text color.
- `#f6f7f2` : This is used for Icon color.
- `#4d4f47` : This is used for shadow.




When you add a color to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your color palette later if needed.




I used [Google](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography


**Icons**


As for icons I decided to use for my website [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library.


**Fonts**


 I've integrated Google Fonts to find a typeface that compliments the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've chosen Roboto Mono due to its optimization for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. I've applied with a "sans-serif" fallback.

-**Hero image**


- Our hero image adds a personal touch that immediately builds credibility and trust for our brand. Because people are highly visual, having high-quality, fullscreen imagery at the top of your page can help create a positive first impression.We also added our location to the image so that the users know immediately where we are located.
