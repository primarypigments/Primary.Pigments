    <h1 class="gallery-heading"> Here you will Examine our Members Works of Art
</h1>
<p class="gallery_text">

  These series of arts of work are manifested by our members inputting their feelings into their work. Many of these
  paintings seem dark, but in fact these are beacons of light. How can this be? This is due to the fact the feelings
  that have trapped them in moments of their lives now have been used for something positive. This action is the
  first step for many to start moving forward and on to new chapter of life. It is good to feel everything you feel.
  It is what makes us human. The important thin red line is what we do or how we use these feelings. Many of
  we use our melancholy for self-destructive behavior. When we actively choose to use this feeling to create
  something beautiful like these works of art, this creates a chain reaction of of using our energy for something
  good. We hope you find yourself inspired. BE SURE TO CLICK OR TOUCH AN IMAGE TO ENTER GALLERY VIEW.
